1. Contains TCL files, shell scripts, awk scripts and cpp files for NS2 simulation [Wireless 802.11 and 802.15 modes]
2. Varied number of nodes, packet rate, number of flows, distance metric etc
3. Contains scripts for graphs of each metrics vs the varied parameters, metrics include Avg Throughput, Energy Consumption, etc
4. Bonus: 
  i) Contains code for Satellite TCL file (varied latitude etc), 4G (varied number of passengers, etc), wired-wireless cross-connection (varied number of Base Stations, number of wireless nodes etc)
  ii) Contains code to measure additional metrics like residual energy per node, instantaneous throughput, link queue variation with time (for wired-wireless configuration) 
5. Modifications: 
  i) Wrt thesis paper for congestion control
  ii) New modification for RTT measurements
